# Low_Income_Housing_Analysis
Given Census Data for households in New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia, I used SAS and R to perform logistic regression analysis to discover various variables that affect the affordability of a household for low-income families.
## Description of Files
Note: I made use of 12 csv files for this project so for the sake of neatness I have decided not to attach them to this repo. Their contents consist of survey data in New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia for what I define as low-income and "super-low income" households. 
* low-income-housing-analysis.sas: This is the SAS file where I perform logistic regression analysis on the given census data. 
* glmnetprocedures.R: This is the R file where I used the GLM Net procedure to determine which of the numerous created covariates should be included in a final logistic regression model for affordability. 
* Low-Income-Housing-Analysis.pdf: This pdf file contains a description of the project, it's goals, the datasets, the analysis and its corresponding figures.
